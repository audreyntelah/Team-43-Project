This is a much more detailed version of the website from the last push I did . I have made some choices like colour scheme and the general layout of the website ,but you guys can change these things as you like I just did it so I could make a start on the website . I have created the login modal which will appear every time the page is loaded (refresh).The modal has the login form, register form and the admin form . Most of the buttons and links on the page do nothing as either the page they go to doesnt exsist yet or the button does something related to the backend . Also if you lot are wondering why there are random grey sections on the page I did this to get an idea of the layout of the page and create some seperation between the slideshow and the owl carousel . I assume we can add some text into the sections . the owl carousel has the images flip round and show the back of them which reveals the a blue background and the name of john doe . This is just used to fill the back of the image in and I thought that the back of the images should have the name of the perfume , a little description and a button to take the user to the perfumes product page .I have also added a searh bar as well to meet the requirements but I havent checked all the requirements to see what I need to put on the home page ,also the search bar does nothing as I think it has something to do with the backend and I think it needs the product databse to search agianst .
